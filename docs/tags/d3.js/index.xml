      <description>I wanted to give a quick update on the project that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on. Today, I managed to render the nodes and links on the canvas and I think I also have a better understanding of D3.js than before.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on creating a network graph to show the relationship between every single Wikipedia article. I wanted to write this article so I can walk through the problem I&amp;rsquo;m having.
The Problem Basically, when I tried to render the network chart I decided to go the conventional route and use an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic). SVGs are awesome for rendering different types of shapes and transitions. For a typical person rendering a few nodes on a network graph, SVGs work well (not to mention that pretty much every tutorial/article on using D3.</description>
