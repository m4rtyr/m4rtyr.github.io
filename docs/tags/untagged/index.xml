      <description>I was working on my project today and I decided to try out a tool that I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in using for a long time. Watson is a time management tracker that you can use to track how much time you spend on your projects. Today, according to Watson, I spent 1 hour and 11 minutes working on my project.
I hope to use it more to track my time and hopefully in the future I can talk about the benefits/cons of using something like Watson.</description>

      <description>Hey there.
This is sort of an update to the article I wrote on trying to use D3.js network charts with canvas. However, after being away from this project for over two weeks and trying out Canvases, I realized a few things:
 Generating graphs with millions of nodes on the client side is horrible. If it were just a few thousand nodes, then it would be ok, but I&amp;rsquo;m generating so many nodes that many clients wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to handle it on their machine (regardless of whether we use Canvas or SVG).</description>
