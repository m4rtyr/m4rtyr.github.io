      <title>Privating Repos</title>

      <description>Recently, I went ahead and private some of my repositories, including repositories of projects that I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on. I just wanted to quickly explain why I&amp;rsquo;m doing this.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to hold myself accountable for the projects I do. Sometimes, when I do a project, I can become uninterested in what I&amp;rsquo;m doing or I&amp;rsquo;ll hold off on it due to other responsibilities. As a result, this leaves me with plenty of repositories, some of which are completed projects and others that are not.</description>

      <description>Hey there.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve last written. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write more this year. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Tomorrow, I plan on making a post. Happy new years! :)</description>

      <description>Hey there.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing recently because I got busy with school/work and felt too tired to write anything. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that this week I can start writing everyday again.

      <title>Unfinished Projects</title>

      <description>Hey there.
I dropped writing for a little bit just to give myself a break and give myself some time to work on my project. Speaking of projects, this year I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to cultivate more persistence. I feel like in the past I would start a project, go somewhat far with it, and then fail to follow through and provide something that worked the way I wanted.
More critically, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel satisfied.</description>

      <title>Why I Stopped Using Lastpass</title>
      <link>https://gh0std3v.github.io/posts/2020/11/why-i-stopped-using-lastpass/</link>

      <guid>https://gh0std3v.github.io/posts/2020/11/why-i-stopped-using-lastpass/</guid>
      <description>For the longest time I used to use Lastpass. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good password manager, but over time I started to have some concerns about whether I should keep using it. So, a few months ago, I deleted my Lastpass account and decided to get a local password manager.
So, why did I do it?
Lastpass is a great password manager without a doubt. Not only is it free, but you can auto-generate secure, random passwords and with its browser extension you can auto-fill password and username fields to make logging into your accounts faster.</description>

      <title>Writing Everyday</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve written anything but I&amp;rsquo;ve decided as of today to start writing everyday for the sake of documenting the work I do and for keeping myself accountable.
That&amp;rsquo;s it.
