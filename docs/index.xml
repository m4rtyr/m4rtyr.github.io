      <title>Socialfinder Part 1</title>

      <description>I wanted to talk more about the project that I mentioned yesterday that I have dubbed &amp;ldquo;SocialFinder&amp;rdquo; (until I can find a better name for it).
Description SocialFinder is a tool to help find people online. In particular, it&amp;rsquo;s a tool that tries to find documents, images, and other information about or relating to an individual online. In essence, a user would enter data about a particular person (such as a name, address, user account, etc) and the tool would try to find people that match that description by scouring the Web.</description>

      <description>As part of the new year, I want to explicitly state the projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on and provide updates on them more frequently. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working on a project that I&amp;rsquo;ve dubbed &amp;ldquo;SocialFinder&amp;rdquo;, which is a tool to help find people on the Internet my scraping the Web for social media profiles, news stories, articles, court records, and more.
Tomorrow, I hope to provide a more detailed description of what the project is, the motivation behind it, and (maybe) provide a deadline of when the first version of the project should be expected to be completed.</description>

      <title>Privating Repos</title>

      <description>Recently, I went ahead and private some of my repositories, including repositories of projects that I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on. I just wanted to quickly explain why I&amp;rsquo;m doing this.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to hold myself accountable for the projects I do. Sometimes, when I do a project, I can become uninterested in what I&amp;rsquo;m doing or I&amp;rsquo;ll hold off on it due to other responsibilities. As a result, this leaves me with plenty of repositories, some of which are completed projects and others that are not.</description>

      <title>An Interesting Fact About Logarithms</title>
      <link>https://gh0std3v.github.io/posts/2021/01/an-interesting-fact-about-logarithms/</link>

      <guid>https://gh0std3v.github.io/posts/2021/01/an-interesting-fact-about-logarithms/</guid>
      <description>Today I learned something interesting about logarithms. Namely, that:
$$\lg x \approx \ln x + \log x$$
with less than 1% error!
The &amp;ldquo;proof&amp;rdquo; behind this is as follows:
$$\frac{\ln x + \log x}{\lg x} = \frac{\frac{\lg x}{\lg e} + \frac{\lg x}{\lg 10}}{\lg x}$$
$$= \frac{(\lg e + \lg 10)(\lg x)}{\lg x \lg 10 \lg e}$$
$$= \frac{1}{\lg e} + \frac{1}{\lg 10}$$
$$ = \ln 2+ \log 2 $$
The above is approximately equivalent to $0.</description>

      <description>Hey there.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve last written. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write more this year. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Tomorrow, I plan on making a post. Happy new years! :)</description>

      <title>Reddit Upvote Predictor Part 1</title>

      <description>Hey there.
I wanted to start working more with Tensorflow, so I decided to do a simple project where I try to predict the number of upvotes a given Reddit post will receive in a certain amount of time.
This project is very suitable for machine learning, since the number of upvotes $y$ that a post gets can be predicted using a linear equation, of the form $\sum_{i=1}^n w_ix_i+b_i$ where $w_i$ and $b_i$ can be calculated through a method such as gradient descent and $x_i$ is the feature in particular.</description>

      <description>Hey there.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing recently because I got busy with school/work and felt too tired to write anything. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that this week I can start writing everyday again.

      <title>Getting a MAC Address on a Mac</title>

      <description>Hey there.
Recently, I needed to write some code in C to get the MAC address of a particular interface. On Linux, this is pretty easy to do. However, on BSD systems and, more importantly, on macOS, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as straightforward and I had to do some digging to find an answer.
On Linux, generally I would find the MAC address by doing an ioctl() call with the argument SIOCGIFHWADDR like so:</description>

      <title>Unfinished Projects</title>

      <description>Hey there.
I dropped writing for a little bit just to give myself a break and give myself some time to work on my project. Speaking of projects, this year I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to cultivate more persistence. I feel like in the past I would start a project, go somewhat far with it, and then fail to follow through and provide something that worked the way I wanted.
More critically, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel satisfied.</description>

      <title>Learning Rust</title>
      <link>https://gh0std3v.github.io/posts/2020/11/learning-rust/</link>

      <description>Hey there.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to write yesterday because I was working on my project. In other news, I decided to learn a little bit of Rust through the Official Rust Book since I used to play around with the C programming language. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve found Rust to be an interesting language that remedies some of the problems with &amp;ldquo;unsafe&amp;rdquo; languages like C while still attempting to give access to the low level.</description>
